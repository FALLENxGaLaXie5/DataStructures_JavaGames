Added 1 again to the set, should be the same
5 item(s), as follows:
0 -1 1 2 3

	0
	-1
	1
	2
	3
Should just have 0 1 and 2 now
3 item(s), as follows:
0 1 2 

Create a second set
The second set has 6 item(s), as follows:
-1 1 2 3 5 8 

The union contains 7 item(s), as follows:
0 -1 1 2 3 5 8 

The first set should be unchanged; it contains 
3 item(s), as follows:
0 1 2 

The second set should be unchanged; it contains 
6 item(s), as follows:
-1 1 2 3 5 8 

The intersection contains 2 item(s), as follows:
1 2 

The first set should be unchanged; it contains 
3 item(s), as follows:
0 1 2
